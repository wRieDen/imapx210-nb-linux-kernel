menuconfig ASYSOPS
	bool "Shared memory, message, lock for Android"
	default y
	---help---
	In Android, standard Unix shared memory, message and lock is abandoned 
	by Google. Instead, Google implements a so called binder to do similar
	operations. But we consider it to be so much complex and too hard to 
	preserve, so we write the same driver to implement it with easier usage.

config ASYSOPS_DEBUG
	bool "print Memalloc debug messages"
	depends on ASYSOPS
	default n
